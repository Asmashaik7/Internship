Key steps in conducting EDA
EDA consists of four main steps, which can be enhanced with GenAI tools:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding the dataset
Before jumping into analysis, take time to familiarize yourself with the dataset. Ask yourself:

What are the key variables (e.g., payment history, income levels, credit utilization)?
Are there categorical or numerical data points?
Are there missing or inconsistent values?
Using GenAI: You can use AI-powered summarization tools to quickly scan a dataset and generate an overview. Tools such as ChatGPT or Google Gemini can help interpret column headers, suggest relevant features, and summarize key statistics.

üí° Example prompt: "Analyze this dataset and provide a summary of key columns, including common patterns and missing values."

2Ô∏è‚É£ Identifying missing values and outliers
Incomplete data can lead to poor predictions. Missing values in credit risk datasets may result from human error, system failures, or unreported financial activity.

Here are some common techniques for handling missing data:

Statistical imputation (industry standard): Replace missing values using well-established techniques such as mean, median, or regression-based imputation. (We've provided a resource with further information on imputation below.)
Understanding missingness patterns: Before filling in missing values, determine whether the data is missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), or missing not at random (MNAR) to avoid introducing bias. This site includes a great overview document explaining the missing data types.
Removing irrelevant data: If a feature has excessive missing values and cannot be meaningfully imputed without introducing bias, it may be best to exclude it‚Äîbut only after assessing its impact on model accuracy and fairness..
Using GenAI (for exploration, not direct imputation):

AI-powered tools can automate missing value detection and summarize data gaps, helping analysts assess which variables require attention.
GenAI can suggest potential imputation strategies based on statistical best practices, but final decisions should be validated with domain expertise.
Synthetic data generation may be an option when real data is unavailable, but it should be validated against real-world distributions to prevent bias.
üí° Example prompt: "Identify missing values in this dataset and recommend the best imputation strategy based on industry best practices."

3Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding relationships between variables
EDA also involves examining how different features interact. For example:

Do customers with high credit utilization rates have a higher risk of delinquency?
Is there a correlation between income levels and late payments?
Using GenAI:

AI models can automate correlation analysis, helping identify key risk indicators.
Instead of manually coding formulas, GenAI can summarize variable relationships in natural language.
üí° Example prompt: "Analyze the correlation between customer income and delinquency risk, summarizing key findings in simple terms."

4Ô∏è‚É£ Detecting patterns and risk factors
The final step in EDA is to identify patterns that could impact delinquency prediction. These might include:

Customers who miss one payment often miss multiple.
Younger customers or those with recently opened accounts may have different risk profiles.
Using GenAI:

AI models can highlight trends in the data, making it easier to understand how different features contribute to delinquency.
AI-assisted insights can be refined by asking follow-up questions, ensuring that the analysis remains relevant to Geldium‚Äôs objectives.
üí° Example prompt: "Analyze trends in late payments and identify the top 3 risk factors associated with delinquency."
