Here is your task
Your job is to translate your predictive findings into a clear, stakeholder-ready report for Geldium’s Head of Collections. This report will be used to inform the team’s next steps and shape how they apply AI insights in their decision-making.

Follow the structure below to build your report.

Step 1: Summary of predictive insights
Use insights from your EDA (Task 1) and the structured predictive model framework (Task 2) to explain: 

What key customer segments are at high risk of delinquency
Which variables most strongly influence delinquency
Refer to the Dataset and Dataset Description Guide (from Task 1) to support your insights with relevant examples or field references.

Prompts to try:

Summarize top predictors of customer delinquency based on dataset analysis.
Identify customer segments with the highest delinquency risk and explain why.
Action: Create a simple 3-bullet list of "Top 3 Risk Factors" for easy communication.

Step 2: Recommendation framework

Choose one key insight and turn it into a SMART business recommendation. Think through:

What action the business could take based on this insight
What action would be most effective, feasible, and aligned with Geldium’s goals?
How you would explain the recommendation to stakeholders
Use the SMART approach to shape your recommendation and prepare a short rationale as to why it’s the right fit. You can use GenAI to help structure your ideas.

Prompts to try:

Turn this insight — 'High credit utilization increases delinquency' — into a SMART business recommendation.
Draft an executive summary explaining why this recommendation will reduce delinquency and align with business objectives.
Action: Write one SMART goal and a 1–2 sentence explanation for stakeholders.

Step 3: Ethical and responsible AI considerations
Outline a brief ethics section, covering:

Any fairness or bias concerns your model or recommendation might raise
How you would explain the model’s predictions to non-technical stakeholders
How your approach promotes responsible and transparent AI use
Prompts to try:

List two fairness risks for a financial risk prediction model and suggest mitigation strategies.
How would you explain AI model predictions in plain language to non-technical stakeholders?
Action: List two fairness risks and how you would mitigate them.

Step 4:  Submit your report
 
Use the report template provided to guide formatting. Write in plain, professional language, using short headings and concise explanations. Your report should be:

Written in plain, professional language
Organized into clearly labeled sections
No more than two pages in length
Deliverable: Upload your completed two-page report as a Word or PDF file. Use the provided report template to guide layout and organization.
