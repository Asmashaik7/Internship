Let's get started
Your team has been working closely with Geldium to enhance their risk assessment strategy. Charithra, your senior manager, has assigned you the first stage of the project: conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to assess dataset completeness, identify patterns, and flag potential gaps that could impact delinquency predictions.

In a recent discussion with Geldium’s Head of Collections, they emphasized the need for a more structured, data-driven approach to identifying at-risk customers. Their current methods rely on historical trends and broad segmentation models, which lack the precision required for proactive intervention strategies. Geldium’s leadership is interested in leveraging AI-driven insights, but before any predictive models can be deployed, we need to ensure that the foundational data is reliable and usable.

During your check-in, Charithra outlines your key objectives:

Review the provided dataset and assess its structure, completeness, and key attributes, and then identify any missing or inconsistent data points that could affect predictions.
Use GenAI-assisted tools to generate insights while ensuring data confidentiality and avoiding the exposure of sensitive financial information.
Summarize the patterns, anomalies, and risk indicators that should be considered in later stages of the project in a report.
This phase is important for setting up a robust predictive modeling process. Your findings will be reviewed by the wider Analytics team and Geldium’s decision-makers to shape the next steps.

With the dataset available and AI tools at your disposal, it’s time to dive into the analysis and provide clear, actionable insights.
