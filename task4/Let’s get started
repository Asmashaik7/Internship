Let’s get started
You're back in a catch-up with Charithra and the Tata iQ analytics team. The business report you delivered in Task 3 successfully highlighted key delinquency risks and potential interventions. Now, Geldium wants to take that a step further: they're looking to automate those interventions.

"We've made strong progress in identifying who is at risk," Charithra begins. "But now we need to design a system that can act on that information in real time. Geldium wants to move beyond manual outreach and static reports to a system that can continuously adapt and optimize collections strategies."

Your new task is to prepare a presentation outlining a framework for an AI-powered collections system that does just that. This means designing a system that uses agentic AI — systems capable of reasoning, adapting, and making autonomous decisions — to optimize and personalize customer outreach at scale. The solution should be practical and forward-thinking, with robust boundaries in place to protect customers and uphold regulatory standards.

To achieve this, you'll need to consider:

How the system will process model outputs and automatically take action (e.g., triggering reminders, adjusting outreach cadence, escalating cases).
Where human oversight is essential, and what limits or controls should be implemented on the AI's actions.
How the system can be adaptive and self-improving — learning from new data to continuously refine its decision-making.
What safeguards are required to ensure fairness, transparency, explainability, and legal compliance throughout the system's operation.
"This isn't just about automation," Charithra adds. "It's about building something trustworthy, strategic, and responsible — a system Geldium can confidently rely on to manage collections effectively and ethically."

The stakeholder presentation you develop will be crucial in shaping how Geldium scales its collections strategy using AI. Let's design it responsibly.
