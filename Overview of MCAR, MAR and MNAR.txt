Overview of MCAR, MAR and MNAR
Datasets can be difficult to work with if you are using real-life data - one of the ways in which problems arise is with missing data. Missing data is a common problem which can occur for a variety of reasons, and can appear as blank or empty cells in a dataset, as NaN or null values, or as an incomplete/non-random sample (amongst others!). Understanding how and why your data is missing is a very important sept in your data cleaning and validation, which is required in carrying out a proper analysis.

Missing data can occur because:

Participants did not provide answers to certain questions for whatever reason
Mistakes occurred in the data entry process
There were issues with data collection instruments
Data was removed to anonymise entries, or sensitive information was omitted to protect participants
Environmental factors did not allow data collection to take place or continue
Data can be missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR) or missing not at random (MNAR). An explanation if these types is provided in this guide.

The tabs of this guide will support you in understanding missing data. The sections are organised as follows:

MCAR - missing completely at random
MAR - missing at random
MNAR - missing not at random
