GenAI Powered Data Analytics Job Simulation
🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains my work for the GenAI Powered Data Analytics Job Simulation (Forage, July–August 2025). Acting as a Data Analyst for Geldium’s Risk Assessment Team, I used Generative AI prompting (ChatGPT/Codey) to perform structured analytics tasks.
The project focused on understanding business problems, framing prompts, and interpreting AI outputs into actionable insights, predictive strategies, and stakeholder-ready reports.
