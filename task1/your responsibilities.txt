Hello,

I’m assigning you to a new project with Geldium, a financial services provider specializing in digital lending and consumer credit. The company has observed an increase in credit card delinquency rates, with more customers missing payments beyond the 30-day late payment threshold. To improve risk management and customer engagement, they have engaged Tata iQ to develop an AI-powered predictive solution that helps identify at-risk customers and recommend appropriate interventions.

The head of Geldium’s Collections team wants to improve how they assess repayment risk and prioritize outreach efforts. Currently, their approach relies on historical trends and manual case handling, which limits efficiency. They are looking for a solution that can:

Use AI-driven insights to help predict which customers are likely to miss payments.
Support the Head of Collections with targeted intervention strategies to reduce delinquency.
Ensure fairness and transparency in AI-driven risk assessments while aligning with industry practices.
 
As an AI transformation consultant, your task is to:

Review available customer data to identify patterns and risk factors.
Develop a predictive model logic using GenAI to forecast delinquency likelihood.
Provide structured recommendations on intervention strategies.
Prepare a PowerPoint presentation outlining how Geldium can implement an AI-powered collections system, including ethical guardrails and expected business impact.

For now, familiarize yourself with the project’s objectives and key challenges. More details will be shared as we move forward. Let me know if you have any questions before we begin.

Looking forward to your insights.

Best,
Charithra
Senior Manager, Tata iQ
