Turning predictive insights into business value
Now that your predictive model has identified which customers are most at risk of delinquency, the next step is to turn those findings into recommendations the Collections team can act on. In the real world, data doesn’t create an impact on its own; decisions do. That’s where you come in.

Predictive insights are patterns your model uncovered — like the fact that customers under 30 with high credit utilization and two or more missed payments are 3.4 times more likely to be delinquent. That insight is valuable, but on its own, it’s just a data point.

A business recommendation is the next step: a practical, strategic action the team can take based on the insight. For example:

“Launch a targeted financial coaching program for at-risk Gen Z customers over the next two months.”

Your role is to bridge the gap between data and action by:

Restating the insight in clear terms
Brainstorming possible responses
Evaluating each option based on feasibility and impact
Selecting one course of action
Justifying it clearly to decision-makers
Next, you'll learn how to structure your thinking into a strong, persuasive recommendation — one that doesn’t just explain the model but supports smart business decisions.
