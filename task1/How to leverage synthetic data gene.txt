How to leverage synthetic data generation to enhance datasets
In financial services, incomplete or inconsistent data can make it difficult to build reliable predictive models. If key information is missing—such as payment history or income details—delinquency risk assessments may become inaccurate. When real-world data is limited, sensitive, or incomplete, synthetic data generation can help fill gaps, simulate scenarios, and improve dataset quality while maintaining privacy and compliance.

Synthetic data is artificially generated data that mimics real-world data patterns. Instead of using actual customer records, synthetic data is created using statistical models or AI-driven techniques to supplement missing values or expand datasets for testing. This ensures that no real customer information is exposed while still preserving the integrity of the analysis.

While synthetic data generation can be useful for filling in gaps and expanding datasets, it should be applied with caution in financial risk modeling. Traditional statistical simulation techniques such as Monte Carlo simulations, bootstrapping, and probabilistic modeling are often preferred due to their explainability, reproducibility, and ability to align with industry regulations.

GenAI-generated synthetic data should be:
✔ Validated against real-world distributions to ensure accuracy.
✔ Cross-checked with statistical models to prevent introducing artificial patterns or biases.
✔ Used as a supplementary tool, not a primary data source, especially in regulatory environments.

When to use synthetic data in financial services:
Enhancing small datasets – If real customer data is limited, synthetic records can supplement training data for AI models.
Filling in missing data – When real data is incomplete, synthetic data can approximate realistic values based on existing patterns.
Testing AI models – Before deploying AI risk models, synthetic data can be used to simulate different delinquency scenarios.
Ensuring privacy compliance – Financial data must be handled responsibly. Synthetic data allows analysis without exposing personal customer details.

As you analyze Geldium’s dataset, you may find missing values that could impact delinquency predictions. If removing or imputing data isn’t viable, synthetic data generation can supplement datasets; however, it must be strictly validated to ensure it accurately reflects real-world trends and does not introduce bias. GenAI-assisted synthetic data generation should be used with caution, as improper constraints can lead to unrealistic outputs that misrepresent risk factors.

💡 Example GenAI prompt: “Generate synthetic payment history data for customers with missing records while ensuring that distributions align with historical patterns observed in the dataset (e.g., standard deviations, typical payment behaviors).”

As you explore Geldium’s dataset, consider whether synthetic data could be useful for filling gaps or testing delinquency risk models. Your approach should balance realism, fairness, and privacy to ensure high-quality AI-driven insights.

Ethical considerations:
While synthetic data can enhance dataset completeness, it must be used carefully to avoid:

Introducing bias – Ensure synthetic records reflect realistic patterns.
Misrepresenting risk factors – Avoid generating overly optimistic or pessimistic data.
Compromising compliance – Validate that synthetic data aligns with industry regulations.
