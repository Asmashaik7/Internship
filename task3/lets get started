Let's get started
You’ve just wrapped up a check-in with Charithra to review the preliminary framework of your predictive model. She’s pleased with the structure and logic you developed in Task 2, and now it’s time to translate those insights into a business-ready report for the client.

“We’re not sending them code,” she says. “What we need is a clear business report that tells a compelling story — something the Head of Collections can actually use to guide strategy and inform the team.”

Geldium’s Collections team is under pressure to make their outreach more targeted. They want to understand which customers are at risk and what actions to take. They’re looking to Tata iQ to translate model outputs into business recommendations they can trust.

Your job is to deliver that narrative. You’ll write a short report that captures the key insights from your model, identifies major risk patterns and customer segments, and recommends what the Collections team should prioritise next. It’s also important to reflect on how these AI-driven decisions are being made. Are they fair? Are they explainable? Would you stand behind these recommendations in front of a room of senior stakeholders?

Charithra encourages you to focus on clarity. “Keep it structured and business-focused. Help them connect the dots from the data to the decisions.”

This is where analytics meets action. Your report is the bridge between your model and real-world impact.
