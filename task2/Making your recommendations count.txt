Making your recommendations count
A strong recommendation should be more than a good idea; it should be specific, feasible, and tied to business outcomes. Here’s a simple process to help you structure yours.

Step 1: Restate the insight
Keep it factual and clear.
Example: “Customers with 2+ missed payments and DTI > 0.5 are 3x more likely to default.”
 

Step 2: Brainstorm actions
List a range of potential responses, considering different types of interventions.

Example:

Send proactive payment reminders (communication strategy).
Offer hardship support (financial assistance).
Lower credit limits (policy change).
Implement personalized debt-management plans.
Provide access to financial literacy resources.
 
Step 3: Evaluate your options
Ask:

Which is most practical to implement within existing operations?
Which has the highest potential impact on delinquency reduction?
Which aligns best with Geldium's overall business goals and risk tolerance?
Which is most cost-effective?
Which has the best scalability potential?
What is the potential impact on customer experience and satisfaction?
Are there any ethical considerations or potential risks of bias?
 
Step 4: Form your recommendation
Craft a SMART action — specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-bound.

A great recommendation is:

Specific – Avoid vague ideas.
Measurable – Link it to an outcome.
Actionable – Feasible within existing operations.
Relevant – Directly tied to the insight.
Clear – Easy for a non-technical stakeholder to understand.
Example: “Pilot a 6-week SMS outreach campaign to high-risk customers, aiming to reduce 30+ day delinquency by 12%.”
 
Step 5: Justify It
Explain why this is the best choice, providing a clear rationale. Consider:

Scalability: Can this be easily expanded to a larger customer base?
Ease of implementation: Can this be done with existing resources and systems?
Fairness: Does this action treat all customer groups equitably?
Anticipated ROI: What is the expected return on investment for this action?
Alignment with business goals: How does this action support Geldium's overall strategy?
Evidence from the data: How does the data support the effectiveness of this action?
 
By using this process, you’ll not only demonstrate strong analytical thinking but you’ll also help the Collections team move confidently from data to action.
