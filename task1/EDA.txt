Introduction to exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Before you start working on your project, it's important to build a solid foundation in the key topics you'll need to understand. This preparation will ensure you have the tools and knowledge necessary to approach your tasks with confidence and skill.

What is exploratory data analysis?
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is the first step in understanding a dataset before applying any predictive models or making business decisions. EDA helps analysts uncover patterns, trends, inconsistencies, and missing values to ensure data quality and reliability. In the context of financial services, EDA plays a crucial role in risk assessment, allowing teams to identify key factors contributing to credit card delinquency and build stronger prediction models. Here is why EDA matters in predicting delinquency:

Ensures data integrity – Identifies missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies before analysis.
Highlights patterns and anomalies – Helps detect trends in customer behavior, such as spending patterns before delinquency.
Prevents biased models – Reduces the risk of unfair treatment by ensuring diverse data representation.
Supports better decision-making – Provides Geldium’s Collections and Risk teams with clear insights for proactive customer engagement.
Without a thorough EDA process, predictive models can be built on flawed data, leading to inaccurate insights, poor risk management, and potentially unfair decision-making. Later in this task, you will examine a dataset related to delinquency risk, identify missing or inconsistent data
